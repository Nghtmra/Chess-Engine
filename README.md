# 📌 Overview

The Bonnyrigg Chess Engine is a complete chess application featuring:

- Drag‑and‑drop piece movement
- Full legal move generation
- Special rule support (castling, en passant, promotion)
- Move highlighting & last‑move tracing
- Multiple board themes
- Sound effects
- Clean object‑oriented architecture

This project was developed as part of the HSC Software Engineering Major Project.

# 🎯 Features

- Intuitive drag‑and‑drop interface
- Real‑time move highlighting
- Hover and last‑move indicators
- Accurate rule enforcement
- Multiple colour themes
- Move & capture sound effects
- Modular, maintainable code structure

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x – main programming language
- Pygame – rendering, input, sound
- VS Code – development environment
- GitHub – version control

# 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies
bash
pip install pygame

4. Run the game
bash
python main.py

# 🎮 Controls

- Action	          Input

- Move piece	     Drag with mouse

- Change theme	     Press T

- Reset game	     Press R

- Quit	          Close window



# 📚 Code Highlights

Object‑Oriented Design:

- Piece subclasses: Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King
- Square class for board cells
- Move class for move representation
- Board class for rule enforcement
- Game class for rendering & interaction
- Dragger class for drag‑and‑drop logic
- Special Rules Implemented
- Castling
- En passant
- Pawn promotion
- Check detection

# 🧪 Testing
The engine was tested for:

- Legal/illegal moves
- Special rules
- Edge cases (check, stalemate positions)
- Drag‑and‑drop behaviour
- Performance (FPS stability)
- Theme visibility
